The "Whatever, Just Take It" License

Look, I'm feeling generous today, so here's the deal: you can have this software
for exactly zero dollars (what a bargain, right?). You can pretty much do
whatever you want with it - use it, modify it, sell it (good luck with that),
or print it out and use it as wallpaper. I really couldn't care less.

Just do this ONE thing (is that too much to ask?):
Keep this ridiculously permissive license text somewhere in your copy.
That's it. That's literally all you have to do. If you can't manage that,
I don't even know what to tell you.

Oh, and here's the fun part (lawyers made me add this):
THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. LIKE, ZERO. NADA.
IF IT BREAKS YOUR STUFF, DELETES YOUR FILES, SETS YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE,
STARTS A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE, OR CAUSES THE END OF CIVILIZATION AS WE KNOW IT,
THAT'S ENTIRELY YOUR PROBLEM. I'M NOT LIABLE FOR ANYTHING, AND I MEAN ANYTHING.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT SUING ME - I SPENT ALL MY MONEY ON COFFEE WHILE
WRITING THIS CODE ANYWAY.

Good luck! You're gonna need it.

P.S. If this actually makes you money, I accept tips in the form of pizza
and energy drinks. Just saying.
